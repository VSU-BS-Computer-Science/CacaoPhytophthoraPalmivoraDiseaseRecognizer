Abstract:  
This study was developed to systematize the recognition of  Phytophthora Palmivora disease on Cacao pod using C4.5 decision tree algorithm. The Cacao pod samples were taken from Visayas State University Cacao farm and manually recognized by Dr. Arsenio P. Ramos, Department of Horticulture, Division Head in Production and Management. Cacao pod samples were captured 9cm from the camera. In this study, 2000 sample images of Cacao pod were used, which were divided into two sets: 1000 images; each for training and testing. The input images were then  cropped to 150x150 pixels. Using the cropped images, features will be then extracted which will be loaded as training data to C4.5 decision tree algorithm. Then, the performance of the recognizer was evaluated by computing the overall accuracy of the system with its Cohen kappa value. The recognizer achieved 84.8% accuracy in correctly recognizing the presence of Pytophthora Palmivora disease in Cacao pod of a sample images and attained a Cohen kappa value of 0.696 â€” Moderate, Level of Agreement. The implementation of this study would help the Cacao farmers in early recognition of Phytophthora Palmivora disease in Cacao farm.
